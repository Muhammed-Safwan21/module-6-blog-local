                Now, let’s come to the skills and approaches that you’re required to follow to become a proficient
                Front-End Developer:</p>

              <ol>
                <li>Learn HTML, CSS & JavaScript <br>
                  You even can’t imagine becoming a key player of Front-End Development by skipping or ignoring
                  these three technologies – HTML, CSS & JavaScript. These are the building blocks of front-end
                  development. All in all, HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is concerned with the structure of the
                  web page whereas CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) looks after the styling of the web page. Moreover,
                  if we talk about JavaScript, it is the client-side programming language that is used to implement
                  interactive functionalities such as animations, audio/videos, maps, and many more on the website.
                  You need to learn the syntax, features & implementation of these languages for creating a website.
                  There are various online platforms available over the web from where you can learn these
                  technologies and can practice your skills as well.</li>

                <li>Get Familiar with Front-End Frameworks: <br>
                  Once you’ll get done with the HTML, CSS & JavaScript, now you need to learn several Front-End
                  frameworks as per your requirement and convenience. In general, the Front-End frameworks are
                  libraries of already written codes and these frameworks make the front-end development easier and
                  efficient due to various features such as reusable components, etc. If we particularly talk about
                  CSS, Bootstrap is the most popular framework in this domain. Moreover, there are various other
                  renowned frameworks such as Angular, React, Vue, etc. that can be taken into consideration for
                  frontend development.
                  Also, you don’t need to learn every single framework out there instead you’re required to pick out
                  the relevant ones based on various factors such as project requirements, market trends, ease of
                  learning, etc.</li>

                <li> Learn Other Relevant Tools & Technologies: <br>
                  Now it’s time to dive deeper into the ocean of Frontend Development and learn about several other
                  crucial tools and technologies. In this context, you need to have a sound knowledge of the Version
                  Control System that allows you to track and control the changes in the source code more
                  conveniently. Some of the most popular version control systems that can be taken into
                  consideration are GitHub, Mercurial, Beanstalk, etc. Also, you need to learn about Responsive
                  Design that is concerned with the compatibility of web page UI with different devices such as
                  computers, phones, tablets, and others. It is a more crucial aspect in Frontend Development as it
                  is directly linked with the User Experience.
                  Furthermore, you need to know about Command Line as well along with the GUI functionalities.
                  You’re also required to get familiar with several Browser Developer Tools that help you to enhance
                  the quality of User Interface. Several other prominent tools and technologies that can also be
                  taken into consideration are Testing & Debugging, CSS Preprocessing, Web Performance metrics, etc.
                  Indeed, getting proficient with these technologies will help you to become a competent front-end
                  developer.</li>

                <li>Build Projects: <br>
                  As they said – Education without application is just entertainment!! So now you need to apply all
                  your learnings & skills of front-end development in the practical world. You can start it by
                  building several mini-projects such as a Quiz Game, To-Do List, etc. and then switch over to
                  projects like Audio Player, Chatting Platform, and others. It will give you some much-needed
                  hands-on experience and the utmost exposure to frontend development. Also, while creating
                  projects, you may end up with various new things or concepts that you might not learn from any
                  book or tutorial.
                  You’re also strongly recommended to contribute to open-source projects as it will not only enhance
                  your skills but will also build your credibility and reputation that eventually can help you to
                  get some worthwhile career opportunities.</li>

                  Frontend Developer. Whether you’re searching for a job in an organization or planning to start
                  something on your own, you need to showcase your previous work to the recruiters or clients to get
                  noticed. Moreover, especially for beginners, you can start it by creating a simple static website
                  for yourself where you can list your completed projects along with the tools & technologies you
                  work upon and your contact details. A well-created portfolio will surely help you to demonstrate
                  your skills in a better way that will provide you an edge over others.</li>
