                <p class="lead">Framework, on the other hand has defined open or unimplemented functions or objects
                  which the user writes to create a custom application. (C++/Java users will understand this as it is
                  much like implementing an abstract function). Because a framework is itself an application, it has a
                  wider scope and includes almost everything necessary to make a user application as per his own needs.
                  Wikipedia makes it more clear: <br><br>
                  “In computer programming, a software framework is an abstraction in which software providing generic
                  functionality can be selectively changed by additional user-written code, thus providing
                  application-specific software” </p>

                <h6>Different Front end Frameworks :</h6>
                <p>In this blog post, we will discuss what a framework is in programming what the most common
                  frameworks are. We’ll also be talking about why developers use frameworks and some potential
                  challenges that can arise. </p>

                <h6>What is a framework?</h6>
                <p>A framework, or software framework, is a platform that provides a foundation for developing
                  software applications. Think of it as a template of a working program that can be selectively
                  modified by adding code. It uses shared resources – such as libraries, image files, and reference
                  documents – and puts them together in one package. That package can be modified to suit the specific
                  needs of the project. With a framework, the developer can add or replace features to give new
                  functionality to the application.</p>

                <h6>What are the different types of frameworks?</h6>
                <p> With the huge variety of programming languages out there, naturally, you’ll find that there are a
                  large number of frameworks available. Each of these frameworks is used to solve different problems
                  that come up in the process of software development. They’re used in many industries, including web
                  development, data science, and more. Here, we’ll go into some of the broader categories of
                  frameworks with examples of specific frameworks within them.</p>

                <h6>Back-End Web Frameworks</h6>
                <p> Back-end web frameworks, or just web frameworks, are the most commonly used programming
                  frameworks. But what are web frameworks? Web frameworks assist developers in making web applications
                  and dynamic websites. These frameworks completely transformed the way web development is done,
                  speeding up the entire software development process by automating common tasks for web developers,
                  like providing database access, session management, and page templates. Instead of building websites
                  using HTML, JavaScript and CSS, back-end frameworks use programming languages to interact with a
                  database to generate content. This means that this work is hosted on a server, hence why it’s the
                  back-end portion. Common back-end web frameworks include: <br>
                  Django – an open-source Python web development framework. It was designed to “help developers take
                  applications from concept to completion as quickly as possible”. A popular choice due to its speed,
                  security, and scalability.
                  Rails – another open-source framework written in the Ruby Language, a programming language designed
                  specifically to be easy to use. Rails is used to run websites like Airbnb, Github, and Shopify. </p>
                <h6>Front-End Frameworks</h6>
                <p> Where back-end web frameworks are loaded on a server, front-end frameworks are executed in a
                  user’s browser. They allow web developers to design what the users see on the website, things like
                  the management of AJAX requests, defining file structures, and styling the website’s components. As
                  they’re a framework, they give web developers a base to develop on while giving them control over
                  what the final output looks like.
                  The most common front-end frameworks are: <br>

                  Angular JS – a front-end JavaScript framework. It was developed and is supported by Google. Features
                  like two-way data binding and dependency injections have greatly helped reduce development time,
                  making this a popular option in the web development community.
                  React – another front-end JavaScript framework developed by the team at Facebook to help them make
                  changes to the site’s code easily. One of its more popular features is the use of virtual DOM,
                  allowing for more seamless site performance and ensuring that high-load applications render faster.
                  Bootstrap – a front-end CSS framework that is a collection of reusable HTML, CSS, and Javascript
                  code. Having all this code pre-defined in a downloadable file allows for developers and designers to
                  save time creating fully-responsive websites. <br><br>
                  Mobile Development Frameworks <br>
                  With the rise of mobile rapidly gaining traction, mobile development frameworks have seen an equally
                  impressive uptick. Like their desktop counterparts, mobile development frameworks give developers a
                  structure that supports the mobile app-building process. They can be split into two different types,
                  native mobile apps (meaning the app would be built for either Apple or Android) and cross-platform
                  frameworks (resulting in an app that’s compatible with any phone). Common mobile development
                  frameworks are:
                  Flutter – A cross-platform app framework that forms native code, meaning you can use one programming
                  language and code base to create an app for both Apple and Android. It was developed by Google and
                  is free and open-source.
                  React Native – A cross-platform app framework that also forms a native code developed by the team at
                  Facebook. It was created with both JavaScript and ReactJS programming languages and comes with
                  ready-made components that can save developers time as they don’t have to create elements from
                  scratch.</p>
                <h6>What makes a good framework?</h6>
                <p> A good framework is: <br>

                  Simple to understand, consistent, and easy to implement. <br>
                  Has a default behaviour that is useful and does something. It should not contain redundant code that
                  doesn’t perform a function. <br>
                  Uses all the best practices from the past, with the ability to evolve in the future. <br>
                  Allows the developer to build components that are reusable. <br>
                  The flow of control is handled by the framework – meaning the framework takes control of the order
                  of processing, not the caller. <br>
                  It can be extended – adding additional code – to provide different functionality. <br>
                  It contains default framework code that can’t be modified, only extended.</p>
                <h6>Why should you use a framework?</h6>
                <p>Frameworks greatly reduce the time and energy spent in developing software. It provides a generic
                  working system that the user can then develop for a specific application by extending the code. All
                  the lower-level details are already included. This allows the developer to devote more time to
                  writing code specific to the project, not in dealing with the mundane, repetitive functions of the
                  framework. They also make the code clean and easily adaptable by following the coding convention of
                  the framework. Finally, frameworks help develop the project quickly, reducing programming time while
                  reducing costs.
                  <br>Potential challenges with frameworks: <br>
                  Frameworks are a one-size-fits-all solution yet have some restrictions. You can’t do anything and
                  everything with a single framework, so some may not be a good fit for certain applications.
                  They are not good for small projects because setting up the framework will take longer than custom
                  coding for the project.
                  As a new user of the framework, there is a steep learning curve. The developer must take the time to
                  understand how to use it correctly before being productive.
                  Any bugs or security issues with a framework can affect every application built on that framework.
                </p>
                <p>Frameworks are a huge help to developers in designing products. They provide an infrastructure that
                  has already figured out the low-level details, allowing the developer to focus on the unique details
                  of the specific project. The developer also has to write less code. And less code means less chance
                  for bugs and less development time, which saves money.
                  Even though frameworks are tedious to learn at first, they become more valuable as they become more
                  familiar. Future projects become faster and easier to complete. And more work in less time makes for a
                  happy developer.</p>
